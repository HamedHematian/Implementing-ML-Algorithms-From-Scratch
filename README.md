# Implementing ML Algorithms From Scratch

#### Current implementation includes following algorithms

  * Neural Network
  * Linear regression
  * Kernel Regression
  * Non-Parmetric Regression
  * Support Vector Machine
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Kmeans
  * Guassian Mixture Model
  * Q-Learning Algorithm

#### This is a collection of ML practical homeworks in university which i have gathered around
